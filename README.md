# medical_suit

### Objective

To represent code structure in flutter while using `flutter_bloc` as a state management library. 

### Brief

MedCo is a sample app that contains some basic flows(signIn, SignUp, and logout). It's a well structred and modifiable code for any application. [Supabase](https://supabase.io) is being used to perform authentication.


### Pending to update:

-   An exception handler
-   Implementation of custom interceptors
-   Firebase notifications
-   Deeplinking
